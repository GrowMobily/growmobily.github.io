### Synopsis
This is my own, failed business attempt. So we can all safely poke fun.

Here's the pitch. Have you ever eaten at a foodtruck? Bliss, am I right?

But you can never *find* one, you have to stumble *upon* a foodtruck. Alas, no more. Foodtrucks can easily input their data and all of their adoring followers will get notifications when they're close by, dishing out goodness.

For some reason, last year, foodtrucks were trendy. To me, it seemed like they'd all be owned by young hipsters, up to date with the latest tech. But when I went to sell the app I'd so lovingly made, it turns out that a majority of foodtruck owners were less interested in what tools could make their business amazingly, wildly, other-worldly successful. They were more interested in the battle-tested process of: find a good spot, serve good food. Aaaaand, I was wrong.

### Interesting points
But there's a silver lining. The app I built took little time to craft. I was able to test a hypothesis without fundraising, hiring a team, wasting mine and/or VC money, and burning years of life.

Good idea. Quick test. Quick fail. Happy.
