### Synopsis
If you're anything like me, which you're probably not, then social media is a little... too much. This new Android/iOS (we developed the Android version) takes all of the good about social media, and throws away all of the "fat", leaving behind a simple, straightforward experience. It's about you, and your connections. Not what they had for dinner last night, or cheezy announcements. (That's all social media is otherwise, right? ;) )

### Interesting points
This was fun because the design was in place, the backend was developed, an iOS version existed, and we just got to iterate on the Android's frontend development. Fortunately, even though we were only responsible for the Android version, we used cross platform technologies so that once the Android version is significantly "ahead" of it's predecessor iOS version, the iOS native code can be retired, and development can continue cross-platformly. (Webster's, is that an adverb?)
