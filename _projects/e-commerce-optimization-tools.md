### Brief synopsis
This company provides tools for e-commerce optimization, and is such needs to interface with a lot of e-retail sites, such as Amazon. I crafted the tools for getting that data.

### Get the data
My code grabs data from many retailers, structures, and stores that data. This allowed us to query that data and provide insights to our clients about what their competitors are up to, and which, of their own offerings, could be improved to stand out more to buyers.


### Get more data
Retailers are constantly adding to/updating their inventories, and my scrapers consequently needed to keep up. I helped with tools for automating scraping, and scaling it up. This created a flow of data that was useful, up-to date, and increasingly "hands-free". This allowed for developers to spend their time on other business problems.
