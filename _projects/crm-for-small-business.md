### Synopsis
When it comes to software, few tools are as essential (and complicated to build) as CRMs. Think "data everywhere". Just everywhere. This helps you organize and act on the important thigs.

### Interesting points
This was a pretty straight forward project. A lot of code was already in place, and we were able to add new features and extend current ones. This meant working a lot within a `Node.js` backend, and an `Angular` frontend. Projects like this feel a bit like being an electrician (or so I imagine they feel like) - wiring up diverse bits to other random bits. 

Interestingly, this and other experiences have led us to investing in building tools to automate the "electrician" side of programming, and free us up to focus on the more interesting business logic. You know, the money-making, value-creating side of things. The wiring side of things can easily take up the majority of a developer's time. With that automated, development becomes magnitudes more efficient. (Note, this is a continual investment in automation/efficiency, our progress toward this Holy Grail of programming will increase with time).
