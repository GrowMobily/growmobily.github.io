### Synopsis
Honey Do is an Android/iOS app for couples. It allows two to create a game between each other of tasks and rewards, and get notified of their partner's flirtatious advances.

### Interesting points
The backend features high scalability, allowing for many couples in the system, while remaining very cheap for our customer to host the backend. (well, free really, until there is a lot more growth, at which point it should remain cheap).

The front end uses cross platform technologies so that we were able to (essentially) code for one platform, and deploy to both the Play Store, and App Store.
