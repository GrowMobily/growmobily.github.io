caption: Automation of internal processes, everyone's happier!
---

### Synopsis
Automation of tedious processes seems to be a theme here. Hm. 

This group had a tedious process that stole hours away from key employees, and was a bit of a thorn to their business customers. With a simple app, a one time investment, they now have all of those hours back, continually, and customers are happier.

### Interesting points
This solution runs a server internally from the employee's computer and allows them to automate sending important reports that customers need regularly. 

Previously, customers would call in, ask for the information verbally, wait as the employee dug up the information, and then they would either get told a couple of the key numbers in the report, or the employee would need to prepare and email the documents. Not to mention all of the customers that wanted their report, but couldn't deal with the process. Not to mention, the employee had better things to be doing. This system handles all of that at the (buzzword-compliant) click of a button.

That pain? Nobody has it anymore.
