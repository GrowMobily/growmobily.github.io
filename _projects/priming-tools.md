### Synopsis
Growth-oriented business people need to keep mentally sharp, and this app helps them do that.

### Interesting points
A unique design of the Minimum Viable Product allows it to be built without a backend, making monthly hosting free for our client. It's built using Facebook's `ReactNative`, a cross-platform technology which gives a native feel. We write the code once, and merely optimize it for each of the Android/iOS platforms in order to deploy to both stores at (roughly) half the cost of developing for both independently. Win!
