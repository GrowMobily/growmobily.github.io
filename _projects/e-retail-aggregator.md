### Synopsis
So you wanna buy something, but not sure what? This app brings all of the best products from many stores into one place, and ices it with a layer of social media. We built a tiny bit of the frontend, and a whole lot of the business logic that ties stores into the app.

### Interesting points
Different retailers format data differently, and, of course, are constantly updating their inventory. So we built a scalable, automated infrastructure for grabbing the data, processing (or "munging" it, if you will), and storing it for later search and indexing. Pretty complicated, and a bit of a drool to talk about.
