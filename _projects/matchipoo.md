### Synopsis
It's actually quite addicting.

It's a timed game, where the timer accelerates as you progress, and you've gotta be super-on-your-toes to stay alive.

### Interesting points
We present this app to show you our humble roots. While simple, it was a good training tool on helping us determine the technology stack for future projects. It also has some interesting algorithmic properties to speed up the logic part of the game.
